# ðŸ§¾ JiraExpense

## What is Atlassian FORGE Quest?

This project was created for the **Atlassian Forge Hackathon: Bonus Level**, where developers were challenged to build apps that extend Jira or Confluence using Atlassianâ€™s Forge platform. I chose the Apprentice path and created an Issue Panel app inside Jira that helps track expenses related to projects or tasks.


## Overview

**JiraExpense** is a lightweight expense tracker that runs right inside a Jira issue panel. Itâ€™s designed for quick, in-context logging of project-related costs like subscriptions, travel, or supplies â€” no switching tabs or using spreadsheets.

You can:
- Add new expenses (name, amount)
- View a list of your entries
- See a running total right inside Jira


## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** â€” using Forgeâ€™s JSX-style syntax
- **Atlassian Forge** â€” for app hosting and platform integration
- **Forge UI Kit** â€” for building the interface
- **Forge Storage API** â€” to store user expense data
- **Forge `invoke()` & resolver** â€” to handle backend logic
- **Jira** â€” runs as an Issue Panel app
